# TriviaGame
For this assignment I started with my HTML creating a bunch of Divs where i could store my data such as questions asked, choices, time left, correct/incorrect answers, the score, and other key pieces for the site. 

Once I had the locations ready, in Javascript i created variables to store the key pieces of information. I stored my questions in different arrays in one variable seperating them by "question" "answerlist" and "answer"

Finally I created functions for new games, new questions, the countdown and scoreboard. I connect to the HTML using Jquery and dot notation.
